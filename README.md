# Leveraging Synthetic FHIR Data and LLM-Driven Insights for Personalized and Confidence-Driven Clinical Trial Matching: A Pipeline for Integrating Real-World Data with ClinicalTrials.gov

High-Risk/Final Project for AI395T, UT Austin, Dr. Ying Ding 

This repository contains the code and resources for a pipeline that leverages synthetic FHIR data and AI-driven insights to streamline personalized clinical trial matching. The pipeline integrates patient data, ClinicalTrials.gov API, and OpenAI GPT-4 to provide match scores and rationales for trial eligibility.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following:

- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher.
- **Git**: For cloning the repository.
- **API Keys**:
  - ClinicalTrials.gov API (if required for enhanced access).
  - OpenAI GPT API key for querying match scores.
- **FHIR Dataset**: A Synthea-generated dataset in FHIR-compliant JSON format.
